    your average vtuber model with one expression would be **around {average_price}$**  
    i will do my best to finish in under **two months**  
    payment method is **Paypal upfront**

    ## content
    - cute is life
    - i have a pretty specific art style and will slightly modify the design to fit that style.
    - i specialize in feminine or androgynous characters. masculine characters might not get accepted.
    - i won't make furry characters, licensed characters, or anything sexually explicit or too graphic.
    - i may accept humanoid cartoon/robot characters, mild ecchi, or mild guro/body horror. so ask me about it!

    ## offerings
    - i currently don't offer togglable poses for vseeface, 2d illustrations, or VRChat rigging.
        these are things i would like to offer in the future, so if it is truly a deal breaker,
        let me know and maybe we could work something out.
        it will come with an additional cost and may add considerable time to the delivery time
    - i'm not offering full character design and will only accept orders with visual references.
        the more detailed the better but a sketch with some pictures found online could suffice.
    - i will not rig models made by someone else.
    - commercial use outside of streaming or content creation is handled on a case by case basis,
        so just ask me about it. if you're a small creator it probably won't be a big deal.

    ---

    ## process
    - commission slots are limited.
        orders are accepted based on how well i can work with the design, not necessarily first come first served.
    - if commission slots are full you can still send me your request
        but i will only get in touch when i intend to start working on it
    - the model should take under two months to complete, but there is currently no upper limit to how long it will take.
        im working on refining this estimate
    - i value communication, poor communication may result in cancellation of the order

    ---

    ## pricing
    i have a high standard for quality and above all want to make something that would look good in a portfolio, not just serve your basic needs.
    i don't skimp. do not try and talk down the price.

    ---

    that said i may adjust the price on atypical models ie cartoon styles, body horror, etc

    ---

    <span class="underline px-1.5">model with basic rigging - {prices.base}$</span>  
    - includes .blend file and a .unitypackage file to import into Unity (you can make it do fortnite dances)
    - model will have: basic humanoid armature, extra bones as necessary for hair/props/expressions, extra shaders/materials as necessary

    <div class="h-1" />

    <span class="underline px-1.5">model with vseeface rigging - {prices.base + prices.vseeface}$</span>  
    - includes everything from above, as well as a .vsfavatar file.
    - one togglable expression is included.
    - rigs will work with either webcam or iphone tracking.
    - rig will have: body + head movement tracking, eye tracking, AEIOU mouth tracking, hair/prop physics, basic looping animations as necessary for props and expressions  

    <div class="h-1" />

    <span class="underline px-1.5">complexity - +0$ and up</span>  
    - i'd like to think of the design as a whole, rather than itemizing every aspect individually.
        hopefully the examples can give you an idea of what the price for your design will be.

    ## 'complexity' pricing
    <div class="px-1.5" >
        <a href="/images/design_complexity_small.png">
            <img class="w-full border-2 border-[#d8d8e8]" src="/images/design_complexity_small.png" alt="design complexity"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    <PriceTable>
        <tr>
            <td>0 - {prices.complexity}$</td>
            <td>- simple; just pants and a tshirt</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>{prices.complexity} - {prices.complexity * 2}$</td>
            <td>- your 'average' vtuber complexity; togglable jackets or hoodies</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>{prices.complexity * 2}$</td>
            <td>- over the top; a lot of little details</td>
        </tr>
    </PriceTable>

    - things that add to model complexity: extra outfits, complex hair, alot of texture detail, accessories, props, kemonomimi
    - things that add to rig complexity:
        complex physics for hair or clothes, idle animations, texture swap toggles, expression toggles, complex atypical facial rigging

    ---

    as an example, the lemons model in the above video - with reasonably complex hair and accessories,
    two expression toggles, kitsunemimi, and hat with different textures -
    would have a complexity cost of around {prices.complexity + prices.lemons_upcharge}$
    and come up to {average_price + prices.lemons_upcharge}$ total

    ---

    there isn't really a limit to this extra cost as it relies on how many extra toggles you want. just let me know what you are looking for and we'll go from there.

    ---

    ## after completion
    - i will help with calibration and bug fixes to the best of my ability,
        please don't hesitate to ask if things arent working right!
    - you can ask for changes or additions to the model but i may charge for them.
        upgrading from webcam to iphone tracking will be no extra charge
    - if you want to modify the model or get it rigged futher by someone else you can do that,
        but it's not my responsiblity to fix it if things go wrong
