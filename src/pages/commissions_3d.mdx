    ## offerings
    - the following things id like to offer but currently don't.
        if it's truly a deal breaker, let me know and maybe we could work something out.
        it will come with an additional cost and may add some time to delivery time:
        <div class="prose-ul:list-[circle] prose-ul:pl-6">
            * togglable poses
            * vrchat rigging
            * warudo rigging
        </div>
    - i'm not offering full character design and will only accept orders with visual references.
        the more detailed the better but a sketch with some pictures found online could work.
    - i will not rig models made by someone else.
    - commercial use outside of streaming or content creation is handled on a case by case basis,
        so just ask me about it. if you're a small creator it'll probably be no big deal

    ---

    ## process
    - commission slots are limited.
        orders are accepted based on how well i think i can work with the design, not necessarily first come first served.
    - if commission slots are full you can still send me a request, but i'll only get back if i intend to work on it
    - the model should take under three months to complete, but there is currently no upper limit to how long it will take.
        im working on refining this estimate
    - i value communication, really poor communication may result in cancellation of the order

    ---

    ## pricing

    - i have a high standard for quality and above all want to make something that would look good in a portfolio, not just serve your basic needs.
        please, do not try and talk down the price.
    - prices listed here will be accurate in most cases but at the end of the day are just guidelines.
    - i may adjust the price for atypical models ie cartoon styles, body horror, etc

    ---

    <span class="underline px-1.5">model with basic rigging - {prices.base}$</span>  
    - includes .blend file and a .unitypackage file to import into Unity (you can make it do fortnite dances)
    - model will have: basic humanoid armature, extra bones as necessary for hair/props/expressions, extra shaders/materials as necessary

    <div class="h-1" />

    <span class="underline px-1.5">vseeface rigging - +{prices.vseeface}$</span>  
    - .vsfavatar file
    - rigs will work with either webcam or iphone tracking.
    - rig will have: body + head movement tracking, eye tracking, AEIOU mouth tracking, hair/prop physics, basic looping animations as necessary for props and expressions  

    <div class="h-1" />

    <span class="underline px-1.5">complexity - +0$ and up, tiers</span>  
    - every model is different and i don't think coming up with a standard set of addons/extras makes sense for my style.
        hopefully the examples can give you an idea of how much your design might cost

    <div class="h-1" />

    <span class="underline px-1.5">togglable expressions - +{prices.expressions}$ each</span>  
    - expressions with simple animation will be the same price

    ## 'complexity' pricing

    when thinking abt complexity, theres design complexity and rig complexity.

    <div class="px-1.5">
        <a href="/images/design_complexity_2.png">
            <img class="w-full border-2 border-[#d8d8e8]" src="/images/design_complexity_2.png" alt="design complexity"/>
        </a>
    </div>

    <PriceTable>
        <tr>
            <td>**tier 0: simple**: {prices.t0}$</td>
            <td>- pikamee, oozora&nbsp;subaru, nekomata&nbsp;okayu, lily&nbsp;hopkins</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>**tier 1: average**: {prices.t1}$</td>
            <td>- inugami&nbsp;korone, gwar&nbsp;gura, kson, fallenshadow, himemori&nbsp;luna</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>**tier 2: detailed**: {prices.t2}$+</td>
            <td>- pipkin&nbsp;pippa, amelia&nbsp;watson, ceres&nbsp;fauna, kureji&nbsp;ollie, sakamata&nbsp;chloe</td>
        </tr>
    </PriceTable>

    - things that add to design complexity: complex hair, frills/lacey stuff, high texture detail, accessories, props, kemonomimi,
        complicated shapes that are hard to repliacte in 3d, togglable hoodies/jackets
    - things that add to rig complexity: complex physics for hair or clothes, idle animations, complex atypical facial rigging
    - very complex rigs or designs may go beyond the {prices.t2}$ price.
    - currently extra outfits don't have a fixed price and will be dealt with on a case by case basis.

    ---

    as an example, i would consider the lemons model in the above video to be tier 2, due to the reasonably complex hair and accessories,
    kitsunemimi, and hat with different textures. with the two expression toggles it would come up to {genPrice(prices, true, 2, 2)}$ total

    ---

    ## after completion
    - i will help with calibration and bug fixes to the best of my ability,
        please don't hesitate to ask if things arent working right!
    - you can ask for changes or additions to the model but i may charge for them.
        upgrading from webcam to iphone tracking will be no extra charge
    - if you want to modify the model or get it rigged futher by someone else you can do that,
        but it's not my responsiblity to fix it if things go wrong
