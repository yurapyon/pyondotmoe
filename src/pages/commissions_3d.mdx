    your 'average' vtuber design rigged for vseeface would be **around {average_price}$**  
    i will do my best to finish in under **two months**  
    payment method is **Paypal upfront**

    ## content
    - i have a pretty specific art style and will slightly modify the design to fit that style.
    - specialize in cute feminine or androgynous characters. masculine characters might not get accepted
    - won't make furry characters, licensed characters, or anything sexually explicit or too graphic.
    - may accept humanoid cartoon/robot characters, mild ecchi, or mild guro/body horror. so ask me about it!

    ## offerings
    - i currently don't offer togglable poses for vseeface, 2d illustrations, or VRChat rigging.
        these are things i would like to offer in the future, so if it is truly a deal breaker,
        let me know and maybe we could work something out.
        it will come with an additional cost and may add considerable time to the delivery time
    - if you'd like a more general VRM rig instead of a vseeface rig,
        i can make that but the features will be limited and it will cost the same.
    - i'm not offering full character design and will only accept orders with visual references.
        the more detailed the better but a sketch with some pictures found online could suffice
    - i will not rig models made by someone else.
    - commercial use outside of streaming or content creation is handled on a case by case basis,
        so just ask me about it. if you're a small creator it probably won't be a big deal

    ---

    ## process
    - commission slots are limited.
        orders are accepted based on how well i think i could do with the design, not necessarily first come first served.
    - if commission slots are full you can still send me your request
        but i will only get in touch when i intend to start working on it
    - if i'm interested in taking your order, i will talk with you a bit to understand what youre looking for,
        let you know how much it will cost and check you are ready to pay, and then send you a payment link
    - poor communication may result in cancellation of the order
    - the model should take under two months to complete, but there is currently no upper limit to how long it will take.
        im working on refining this estimate

    ---

    ## pricing
    - i have a high standard for quality and above all want to make something that would look good in a portfolio, not just serve your basic needs.
        i don't skimp. dont try and talk me down in price.

    ---

    - <span class="underline">base model - {prices.base}$</span>  
        includes .blend file and a .unitypackage file to import into Unity (you can make it do fortnite dances).
        basic humanoid rigging and hair/prop rigging
    - <span class="underline">vseeface rigging - +{prices.vseeface}$</span>  
        includes .vsfavatar file. one togglable expression is included.
        rigs will work with either webcam or iphone tracking
    - <span class="underline">complexity - +0$ and up</span>  
        i'd like to think of the design as a whole, rather than itemizing every aspect individually.
        hopefully the examples can give you an idea of what the price for your design will be.

    ## 'complexity' pricing
    [![design complexity](/images/design_complexity_small.png)](/images/design_complexity_small.png)
    <PriceTable items={[
        {price: `0 - ${prices.complexity}$`, thing: "- simple; just pants and a tshirt"},
        {price: `${prices.complexity} - ${prices.complexity * 2}$`, thing: "- your 'average' vtuber complexity; togglable jackets or hoodies"},
        {price: `${prices.complexity * 2}$`, thing: "- over the top; a lot of little details"},
    ]} />
    - things that add to model complexity: extra outfits, complex hair, alot of texture detail, accessories, props, kemonomimi
    - things that add to rig complexity:
        complex physics for hair or clothes, idle animations, texture swap toggles, expression toggles
    - there isn't really a limit to this extra cost as it relies on how many extra toggles you want
    - just let me know what you are looking for and we'll go from there.

    ---

    as an example, the lemons model in the above video - with reasonably complex hair and accessories,
    two expression toggles, kitsunemimi, and hat with different textures -
    would have a complexity cost of around {prices.complexity + prices.lemons_upcharge}$
    and come up to {average_price + prices.lemons_upcharge}$ total

    ---

    ## after completion
    - i will help with calibration and bug fixes to the best of my ability,
        please don't hesitate to ask if things arent working right!
    - you can ask for changes or additions to the model but i may charge for them.
        upgrading from webcam to iphone tracking will be no extra charge
    - if you want to modify the model or get it rigged futher by someone else you can do that,
        but it's not my responsiblity to fix it if things go wrong
