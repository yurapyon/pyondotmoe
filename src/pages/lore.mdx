    1. Muddle the mint
    2. Add gin, honey syrup, lemon juice and mint to a shaker with ice
    3. Shake and strain into a cup
    4. Top up with Topo Chico

    - Honey syrup should be 2:1 water:honey, or 1:1:1 water:simplesyrup:honey  
    - Fresh squeezed lemon is the way to go
    - We are still searching for a source of 'cardboard' flavor, and the recipe will be updated when that is found
    - Gin currently being tested is Tanqueray London Dry Gin, but this may change in the future
