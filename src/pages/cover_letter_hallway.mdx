<div class="px-1.5 not-prose">
    Hey! I'm Mel.  
    I saw this listing on Hacker News and was immediately super interested!

I'm a pretty experienced programmer but more importantly I am a huge fan of vtubers.
I've been watching vtubers daily since Hololive's EN branch debuted in 2020, and over time I've just gotten more and more involved.
Right now I mostly watch indie vtubers on Twitch but I still tune into some HoloJP streams and Chihiro Yuki from time to time.

I'm really passionate about vtubing!!!
I love watching the streams and I think the technology is really freeing for people.
I know there's many people who would never have an online presence if not for vtubing.
I actually recently opened commissions for VSeeFace avatars, and a commission example can be seen here:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM-Wyif_W_0" target="_blank">youtube.com/watch?v=TM-Wyif_W_0</a>.
They're very stylized but I've been making digital art for a long time so I'd hope that's the appeal.

I'm very familiar with low level programming and OpenGL.
I haven't used much C++ but only because I was more interested in C, Zig and Rust.
I'm a bit more of a generalist with programming than specializing in specific languages or frameworks.
I was working a little with Mediapipe over last summer, working on making my own 3dtuber software, but I decided to go for the VSeeFace route for commissions, just for ease of adoption by commissioners.

As far as professional experience goes, I have some pretty solid full-stack web dev experience from my last job at a startup. 
I went in knowing very little, but thanks from the help of the founders I got up and running pretty quickly.
The stack we used there was centered around Next.js which allowed us to iterate quickly, get new features out all the time and have bugs resolved within hours.

I love working at small companies for the high impact one person can have and the ability to move fast and constantly be shipping.
It's really exciting to me to be thrown into a situation where I don't know much and have to figure things out for myself.
I love working with customers 1-on-1 and getting feedback.
