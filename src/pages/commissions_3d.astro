            <b>pricing breakdown</b> <br/>
            this is how i think about pricing. most of this is very fuzzy and its just to get an idea. <br/>
            a prop is anything that requires extra bones in the rig beyond a human skeleton i.e. kemonomimi, baseball bat, simple wings. things like hats or collars i dont really count<br/>
            a toggle is a part of the model you can turn on and off in vseeface, or an expression <br/>

            <b> base model - 125$ </b> <br/>
            includes .blend file, humanoid rigging for unity (you can make it do fortnite dances)<br/>

            <b> vseeface rigging - +75$ </b> <br/>
