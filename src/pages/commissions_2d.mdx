    ## content
    - cute is life!!!
    - i also like creepy cute or weird cute type stuff. yea
    - i'm best at feminine or androgynous characters. masculine characters probably won't get accepted
    - i wont draw nonhuman characters, anything ecchi or sexually explicit, licensed characters, or any guro/body horror thats too gross or graphic.
    - i may accept mild ryona/guro/body horror.

    ## skeb style

    currently my commission process is similar to the japanese concept of a 'skeb'

    ---

    basically the process would be:
    1. send me an email with all the info for what you are looking for, and what tier of drawing you want.
    2. if i accept your order i will send you a payment link and an ETA on when you can expect me to finish the order.
    3. when im finished with the order i'll send you the drawing.
    4. thats it!

    ---

    it will be easier for now until i can figure out exactly what i want to offer.
    because it's skeb style, prices are cheaper than if i was offering a more communicative commission process.

    ---

    ## if i know you personally

    if i know you personally i may offer a more communicative commission process at a slightly higher cost.
    i may also accept orders that are a little more nsfw.
