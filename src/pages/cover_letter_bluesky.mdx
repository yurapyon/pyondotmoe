### Hello! I'm Alex  
### I saw this listing on HackerNews and was immediately really interested.  

---
  
I'm an avid Twitter user, mostly following artists and illustrators, but also using it to talk with friends.
I also manage my own online presence as a digital artist.
Unfortunately recent events have made the future of Twitter as a discovery platform shaky and unknown.
I know firsthand how important social media can be for the livelihoods of online creators.  

I'd be thrilled to work at Bluesky, having a hand in making social media better for creators and casual users.

My last job was at a small 5-person startup, working on a Zoom/Discord alternative for live-streamers with high quality, low latency video.
I went in knowing barely anything about web dev, but thanks to the help of the founders I picked up everything pretty quickly.
The stack we used there was centered around Next.js which allowed us to iterate quickly, get new features out all the time and have bugs resolved within hours. 

---

I love being in an environment where I know nothing and have to figure things out for myself.
I love working at small businesses for the high impact one person can have, and the ability to work on a project from initial planning to completion.
It was always really exciting to get a new feature out and be able to get customer feedback in a personal 1-on-1 way.

---

I'm a generalist when it comes to programming and rely on my software design experience as a whole to guide me rather than specializing to languages and frameworks.
That said I do have Typescript and React experience in a professional setting.
I've done some API route design and working with databases, but I'd be willing to learn it more in depth.

### Thanks for your time and I hope to hear back soon!!
