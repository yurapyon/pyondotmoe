        # Drawing Commissions Terms Of Service
    </div>
    <div class="h-1" />
    Any of the terms listed here are subject to change on a case by case basis, agreed on through further
    correspondence between myself and the client.

    ---

    ## process
    - Drawing commissions are offered in a 'Skeb' style. This means after the commissioner has paid for thier order,
        no communication will be given besides delivering the order to the client when it is complete.
    - I may show the creation of the art on stream or social media.
        If you take issue with this, be sure to let me know beforehand.

    ---

    ## payment
    - Payment is through Paypal and must be paid in full before I begin work.
    - Payment for the commission must be sent within 3 business days of me sending the payment link,
        or the order may be cancelled and the commission slot given to someone else.

    ---

    ## cancellation
    - I may cancel your order at any time for any reason,
        including but not limited to my own personal life issues or rudeness on your part.
    - If I cancel your order a full refund will be given.
    - You may cancel your order at any time but you will not be refunded.

    ---

    ## usage
    - I alone own the rights to the art and may use it for any purpose in the future. 
        Continued use of the art by the client is contingent upon upholding these terms and any agreements reached outside of them.
    - Art may be used for personal use only.
        Other commercial uses, including selling merchandise using the art, are handled on a case by case basis.

    {/*
    - The model may be used in a modified form but you must not misrepresent any modifications as part of the original work.
    - You may not resell the model in full or in part, in its original or any modified form. Renders of the model may not be sold.
    - Model and renders of the model may not be used for anything related to NFTs (non-fungible tokens),
        cryptocurrencies, or AI-generated art.
    - Credit must be given on the internet profile you use the model most frequently.
        Acceptable credit is a link to my website (pyon.moe), my twitch account (twitch.tv/bitelemons),
