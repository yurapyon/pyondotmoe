            i'm new to doing commissions and im still working on my artstyle and pricing.

            complex character designs may cost more, based on my discretion
            </p>

            <p>
            i specialize in human characters but may be down to make robot or furry characters.
            mild guro/body horror themes are okay! mild ecchi is also okay! 
            however, i will reject anything i deem too intense and will not do any sort of explicit sexual content.
            </p>

            <p>
            if youre looking for something completely inhuman or abstract, i may be down to do that too!
            pricing for that would be completely custom and wouldnt necessarily follow the prices on this page.

            extras are organized by tiers, with the price of each tier an estimate price.
            complexity in the modelling or rigging may add price

            <span class="font-bold"> i want to work with you to make something epic!!!  </span>

            <p>
            if you want something special, dont be afraid to ask. i want to make really cool models and want to push my abilites.
            please be understanding if i reject your request, if it costs more, or if it takes an indefinite extra amount of time.
            i put alot of love and care into everything i do.
            just because its lopoly doesn't mean it doesnt take a f**kton of work to get right :)
            </p>

            <p>
            i know how to make VRM models + VSeeFace models.
            i may be willing to figure out how to make models for other programs it's a deal breaker! ask me about it!
            </p>

            <p>
            i don't currently offer VRChat models but would like to in the future...
            if this is something you //really// want i may be down to talk about it.
            </p>

            <span class="font-bold"> gritty details </span>

            <p>
            process time: 3-4wk, barring adverse life situations.
            may take shorter but this is what i expect.
            these are not hard limits but as i will refine this estimate over time :)
            </p>

            <p>
            i will give updates fairly frequently to make sure the model looks how you want it.
            i am pretty confident in my artistic sense though, so do not be too demanding or request difficult revisions.
            </p>

            <p>
            this commission is for a rigged 3d model to be used for streaming/vtubing.
            you can ask me if youre looking for 3d models for other uses, but there is a high chance i will reject it.
            i will not rig models made by other people.
            </p>

            <p>
            if you can, please provide concrete visual references for what youre looking for.
            they dont have to be really well drawn or anything but im not exactly offering character design.
            </p>

            <p>
            3d is hard to do from scratch so i may reuse assets i have used for other models on your model i.e. kemonomimi or props.
            i will however modify them to fit your design if need be.
            </p>

            <p>
            future model updates are not included, but can be asked for and may cost extra.
            </p>

            <span class="font-bold"> i have right to reject any request or the design in full! </span>
            <!-- todo make list -->
            <p>
            model is too complex.
            VSeeFace doesnt support such things or it would be too hard.
            youre mean.
